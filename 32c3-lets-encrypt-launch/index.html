            <li>HTTPS is just HTTP wrapped with TLS</li>

            <ul>
              <li>passive monitoring of plaintext connections is a real problem, esp for passwords + other PII</li>

              <li>despite 20 years of work, still has low usage rate vs HTTP :/</li>
              <li>we ran tests that show getting + installing a cert can take 1+ hr even for experienced devs/sysadmins</li>
              <li>every CA has it's own validation/issuance processes (which are generally proprietary) which makes life even more complicated</li>

            <li>Already public and widely trusted!</li>

          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>Completely open source (both server + client)</li>
              <li>as little human interaction as nessecary, none needed for issuance, still need ops folks</li>
              <li>publishing all certificates we issue to numerous CT logs</li>
              <li>very few old devices (/old Java) don't have the DST root, otherwise p. much everyone trusts us due to cross-sig</li>
              <li>ACME is still a draft, but should be finalized soon! /(mb adopted by more people)</li>
